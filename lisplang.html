                <h3 id="what">What is Lisp?</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Lisp is a family of programming languages descended from a language John McCarthy invented (or more accurately, discovered) in the late 1950s. The two main dialects now are Common Lisp and Scheme. There's a new dialect called Arc that is also available.

                <h3 id="how">How can I learn Lisp?</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The way to learn any language is to write programs in it. You have two main dialects to choose between: Scheme and Common Lisp. They each have advantages and disadvantages, but the differences between them are tiny compared to the differences between them and other languages, so if you want to start learning Lisp, it doesn't matter which you choose.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are good books about both dialects, and many good free implementations. So get a book and an implementation, and start trying to write programs. Read existing source code to get an idea of Lisp style. If you run into trouble, ask on comp.lang.lisp. People there are always willing to help newbies.

                <p>
                    Common Lisp is powerful but ugly. Scheme is small and clean, but the standard only defines the inner core of the language. If I had to deliver an application I'd probably use Common Lisp; if I were teaching a course I might use Scheme (but with Common Lisp macros).

                <p>
                    Most hackers I know have been disappointed by the ML family. Languages with static typing would be more suitable if programs were something you thought of in advance, and then merely translated into code. But that's not how programs get written.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The inability to have lists of mixed types is a particularly crippling restriction. It gets in the way of exploratory programming (it's convenient early on to represent everything as lists), and it means you can't have real macros.
                </p>

                <h3 id="perl">Couldn't you add something equivalent to Lisp macros to languages like Perl or Python?</h3>
                <p>
                    Not without turning them into dialects of Lisp. Real macros need to operate on the parse tree of the program. To allow that in a language with syntax, you have to (a) make public the translation from source code to parse trees, and (b) give the programmer the opportunity to run programs on parse trees before they go on to the compiler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But it would be hard to do that without creating a notation for parse trees; and once you do, your language has become a skin on Lisp, in much the same way that in OS X, the Mac OS became a skin on Unix.
