                    Find a friend who knows how to program. Get them to set you up with a system where you can edit and run programs. Use whatever language they suggest for a beginner (probably it will be Python or Ruby). Then get the O'Reilly book and start working through it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As you learn the mechanics of writing and running a program, start thinking about specific programs you want to write. That will motivate you to learn more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Don't start with a problem that's too big. A good way to begin is to take an existing program and modify it to do something new.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Initially your programs will be ugly, but don't worry about that. Everyone's are. Just keep going, and they'll get better.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As you learn, you'll find it useful to look at programs other people have written. But you'll learn more from this once you've tried programming yourself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, find friends who like to write programs. They can answer your technical questions; you'll get new ideas from talking to them; and they'll be the audience for your first efforts.

                    If you're trying to solve a simple, predefined problem like doing a depth-first search, thinking everything out beforehand doesn't hurt.  But few real problems are like that. In real-world applications, you don't usually know at first precisely what problem you're trying to solve.  So if you spend a lot of time planning in advance, what you'll end up with is a minutely detailed plan for solving the wrong problem.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With complex, ill-defined problems, you're better off writing a prototype as fast as you can, seeing what turns out to be wrong with it, and then changing your definition of the problem accordingly.<br><br>Often the reason programmers are pushed into planning is not that the problem requires it, but that project managers require it. Maybe programmers should give managers an explicit choice: do you want me to solve the problem in the way that will make you feel good, or the way that will yield the best solution?

                    Yes and no. A lot of what seem to be OO problems turn out not to be if you have random access to the concepts that together comprise object-orientedness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If I were writing a CAD program or a simulation, for example, I'd probably use OO abstractions (though I'd probably end up creating my own OO model with macros instead of using whatever came with the language).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But if I were trying to solve the problem one reader sent to me as a canonical example of an OO problem, I wouldn't.
                    
                        <blockquote><i>
                        Suppose you have n serial ports, each of which may speak one of k protocols, and this must be configurable at run-time.
                        </i></blockquote>
                    
                    I'd just use an n-by-k array of closures to represent this.
